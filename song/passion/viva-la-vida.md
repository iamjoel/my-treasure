I used to rule the world
大千世界曾由我主宰

Seas would rise when I gave the word
巨浪也曾因我之命澎湃

Now in the morning I sweep alone
如今我清晨独扫

Sweep the streets I used to own
扫视我曾经拥有的街道

I used to roll the dice
凡人生死曾由我主宰

Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
尽情品味惊恐在死敌瞳孔绽开

Listen as the crowd would sing:
听人群高唱

"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
先王亡矣！新王万代！”

One minute I held the key
此刻我手握权位经脉

Next the walls were closed on me
深墙遂将我紧闭

And I discovered that my castles stand
恍然发现我的城池

Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
基底散如盐沙,乱似尘埃

I hear Jerusalem's bell's ringing
听那耶路撒冷钟声传来

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
罗马骑兵歌声震彻山海

Be my mirror my sword and shield
担当我的明镜，利剑和盾牌

My missionaries in a foreign field
我的传教士屹立边疆之外

For some reason I can not explain
只因一些缘由我无法释怀

Once you know there was never, never an honest word
一旦你离开这里便不再，不再有逆耳忠言存在

That was when I ruled the world
而这便是我统治的时代

It was the wicked and wild wind
凛冽邪风呼啸袭来

Blew down the doors to let me in.
吹散重门使我深陷阴霾

Shattered windows and the sound of drums
断壁残垣，礼崩乐坏

People could not believe what I'd become
世人不敢相信我已当年不再

Revolutionaries Wait
起义大军翘首期待

For my head on a silver plate
有朝一日我站上断头台

Just a puppet on a lonely string
恰如傀儡随吊线寂寞摇摆

Oh who would ever want to be king?
悲哉，谁又曾渴望万人膜拜？

I hear Jerusalem's bell's ringing
听那耶路撒冷钟声传来

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
罗马骑兵歌声震彻山海

Be my mirror my sword and shield
担当我的明镜，利剑和盾牌

My missionaries in a foreign field
我的传教士屹立边疆之外

For some reason I can not explain
只因一些缘由我无法释怀

I know Saint Peter will call my name
我亦知天堂之门不会为我敞开

Never an honest word
不再有逆耳忠言存在

But that was when I ruled the world
但这却是我统治的时代

(Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)
喔~~~~~~

Hear Jerusalem's bell's ringing
听那耶路撒冷钟声传来

Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
罗马骑兵歌声震彻山海

Be my mirror my sword and shield
担当我的明镜，利剑和盾牌

My missionaries in a foreign field
我的传教士屹立边疆之外

For some reason I can not explain
只因一些缘由我无法释怀

I know Saint Peter will call my name
我亦知天堂之门不会为我敞开

Never an honest word
不再有逆耳忠言存在

But that was when I ruled the world
但这却是我统治的时代

Oh
喔~~~~~~
