# The Sound Of Silence

hello darkness my old friend.嘿,黑夜啊,我的老朋友.

i've come to talk with you again.我又来找你聊天了.

because a vision softly creeping.因为有个幻影无声无息地爬过.

left its seeds while i was sleeping.趁我熟睡时留下了种子.

and the vision that was planted in my brain.这幻影在我脑海里种下了根.

still remains.萦绕不去.

within the sound of silence !于寂静无声的此刻!
in restless dreams i walked alone.在无数浮躁的梦中我茕茕独行.

narrow streets of cobble stone.行走在鹅卵石铺就的狭窄街道上.

'neath the halo of a street lamp.头顶上街灯的光晕将我笼罩.

i turned my collar to the cold and damp.我翻起衣领以抗御此夜的寒冷及潮湿.

when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light.当我的眼睛被霓虹灯的闪烁刺痛时.

that split the night.也划破了夜空.

and touched the sound of silence.打破了黑夜的沉静.

and in the naked light i saw.在无遮灯照耀下我看到-

ten thousand people, maybe more.数以万记的人,或许更多.

people talking without speaking.有的人在说着无聊的话语.

people hearing without listening.有的人在漫不经心的听着别人说.

people writing songs that voices never share.有的人在写着那些从不会被传唱的歌.

and no one dared.但没有人敢于去-

disturb the sound of silence.打破这份静默.

"fools" said i "you do not know."我说道:"愚蠢的人啊,你们不知道"

"silence like a cancer grows."静默会像癌细胞那样扩散.

"hear my words that i might teach you."听我的话,我才能教导你.

"take my arms that i might reach you."抓紧我的手,我才能救你.

but my words like silent rain-drops fell.但是我的话却如寂静无声的雨点落下.

and echoed in the wells of silence.徒然回响在沉静的天井中.

and the people bowed and prayed.人们仍然顶礼膜拜着.

to the neon god they made.自己塑造的霓虹灯神像.

and the sign flashed out its warning.霓虹灯突然闪烁出警兆.

in the words that it was forming.警告的语句渐渐成型.

and the sign said "the words of the prophets.预兆显示:先知的预言

are written on the subway walls and tenement halls".都被写在地铁的墙上及出租公寓的走廊上.

and whispered in the sounds of silence.这告诫也在无声的静默中被轻声传送.
