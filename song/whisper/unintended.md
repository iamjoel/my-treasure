# Unintended
> Muse

You could be my unintended
无意中选择了你

Choice to live my life extended
我的生活从此无限延伸

You could be the one I'll always love
我会一直爱着你

You could be the one who listens to my deepest inquisitions
因你听到了我内心深处的祈求

You could be the one I'll always love
我会一直爱着你

I'll be there as soon as I can
我会尽快到你身边

But I'm busy mending broken

Pieces of the life I had before
过往的碎片

First there was the one who challenged
有人质疑

All my dreams and all my balance
我的梦想和打破我的平衡

She could never be as good as you
她永远不会像你那么好

You could be my unintended

Choice to live my life extended

You should be the one I'll always love
我会一直爱着你

I'll be there as soon as I can
我会尽快到你身边

But I'm busy mending broken
我正全力缝补

Pieces of the life I had before

I'll be there as soon as I can

But I'm busy mending broken

Pieces of the life I had before
过往的碎片

Before you
