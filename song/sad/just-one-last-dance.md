# Just One Last Dance

Just one last dance oh baby just one last dance
最后一曲，哦，亲爱的，最后一曲

We meet in the night in the Spanish cafe
那个夜晚，我们在西班牙咖啡馆相遇

I look in your eyes just don't know what to say
望着你的双眸，心有千言竟无语

It feels like I'm drowning in salty water
泪水已令我尽陷沉溺

A few hours left 'til the sun's gonna rise
几个时辰过后，阳光便要升起

Tomorrow will come an it's time to realize
明日终将到来

Our love has finished forever
爱情永远分离

How I wish to come with you (wish to come with you)
多想和你一起，和你一起

How I wish we make it through
多想共同继续

Just one last dance
最后一曲

Before we say goodbye
再说别离

When we sway and turn round and round and round
一次次挥手转身

It's like the first time
初次相遇般难舍难离

Just one more chance
再多一次机会

Hold me tight and keep me warm
紧紧拥抱，充满爱意

Cause the night is getting cold
因夜已渐冷

And I don't know where I belong
我意乱情迷

Just one last dance
最后一曲

The wine and the lights and the Spanish guitar
夜光美酒，琴声响起

I'll never forget how romantic they are
浪漫之夜，永难忘记

But I know' tomorrow I'll lose the one I love
我知道明日将痛失吾爱

There's no way to come with you
永远不能再相偎相依

It's the only thing to do
舍此无它
