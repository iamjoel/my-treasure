# Yellow
> Coldplay

Look at the stars
抬头仰望漫天繁星

Look how they shine for you
看它们为你尽情闪耀

And everything you do
你的一举一动

Yeah they were all yellow
却是如此羞涩胆怯

I came along
一路走来

I wrote a song for you
我为你写了首歌

And all the things you do
心里想着你举手投足间的羞涩

And it was called yellow
给这首歌取名叫青涩

So then I took my turn
我全心全意 费尽心思

Oh all the things I've done
想要俘获你的芳心

And it was all yellow
可有时也会害怕胆怯

Your skin
你的肌肤

Oh yeah your skin and bones
哦耶 你那冰肌玉骨

Turn into something beautiful
是如此的美丽脱俗

D'you know you know I love you so
你可知道 我深深地爱着你

You know I love you so
你可知道 我深深地爱着你

I swam across
我的心徜徉在爱里

I jumped across for you
我的心迫不及待想飞奔到你面前

Oh all the things you do
哦 可我却不敢轻举妄动

Cause you were all yellow
因为你是如此的羞涩腼腆

I drew a line
我画了副画

I drew a line for you
我画出了你的肖像

Oh what a thing to do
哦 我不知如何是好

And it was all yellow
因为你是如此羞涩

Your skin
你的肌肤

Oh yeah your skin and bones
哦耶 你那冰肌玉骨

Turn into something beautiful
是如此的美丽脱俗

D'you know for you I bleed myself dry
你可知道 我愿为你倾尽所有

For you I bleed myself dry
我愿为你倾尽所有

Its true look how they shine for you
这是真的 看那漫天繁星为你闪烁

Look how they shine for you
看那漫天繁星为你闪烁

Look how they shine for
看那漫天繁星为你闪烁

Look how they shine for you
看那漫天繁星为你闪烁

Look how they shine for you
看那漫天繁星为你闪烁

Look how they shine
看那漫天繁星为你闪烁

Look at the stars look
仰望星星点点

How they shine for you
看它们为你绽放光芒

They all the says you do
而你的一举一动却是如此羞涩
